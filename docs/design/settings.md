# MCM settings pages

This is a textual design document for the MCM settings design. This design is realized in the file [`config.json`](../../data/mcm/config/SoulsyHUD/config.json). Settings defaults are defined in `settings.ini` in the same directory. We design the menu pages here because the test/loop cycle is agonizing, and editing the json file is also painful.
